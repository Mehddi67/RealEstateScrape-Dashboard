# RealEstateScrape-Dashboard

# Description

Welcome to the RealEstateScrape-Dashboard project, developed as part of our Master's program in Data Science at the Faculty of Economics and Management. This project focuses on scraping real estate data from a website, storing it in a CSV format database, and creating an interactive dashboard for data visualization and analysis.

# Project Objectives

**Web Scraping:** We scrape data from a real estate website, extracting essential information from property listings such as price, area, number of rooms, postal code, and more. This data is collected and processed for further analysis.

**Data Enrichment:** We enhance the dataset by adding additional variables, including the price per square meter and the average price per square meter for each region.

**Geo-spatial Integration:** We incorporate a GeoJSON-format database, merging it with a portion of our enriched data. This integration enables us to display a map of France with regional boundaries, providing a clear visual representation of different regions.

**Interactive Dashboard:** Using Streamlit, we create an interactive dashboard that simplifies apartment searches. The dashboard allows users to apply filters and specific criteria, view various trends through charts and histograms, and explore the map displaying regional average prices per square meter. This user-friendly interface enhances data exploration and understanding.
